CAMEL
=====
Contextual Machine Learning Through the Analysis and Chunking of Partially Translated Grade 2 Braille.

I have an deep disgust for hard coding â‡’ CAMEL is the program I wrote to automate the creation of a Grade 2 Braille dictionary.

I beg your pardon on the silliness of repeated files and other monstrosities. My past projects are slowly migrating onto github: this project was done as I learned to code in Python.
